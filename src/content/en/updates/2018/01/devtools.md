# What's New In DevTools (Chrome 65) {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/kaycebasques.html" %}

Note: The video version of these release notes will be published around
early-March 2018.

New features coming to DevTools in Chrome 65 include:

* Network overrides
* Color contrast line
* New audits
* Puppeteer 1.0
* Multiple Performance recordings
* Code stepping with workers
* New "Step Into" behavior

Note: Check what version of Chrome you're running at `chrome://version`. If you're running
an earlier version, these features won't exist. If you're running a later version, these features
may have changed. Chrome auto-updates to a new major version about every 6 weeks.
